title: "DPA: A one-stop metric to measure bias amplification in classification datasets"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/DPA
excerpt: '
Most ML datasets today contain biases. When we train models on these datasets, they often not only learn these biases but can worsen them --- a phenomenon known as bias amplification. We propose a better metric to measure bias amplification.'
