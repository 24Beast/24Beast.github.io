Hello there! I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Arizona State University, supervised by [Dr. Hannah Kerner](https://hannah-rae.github.io/). My current research focuses on addressing problems related to algorithmic biases and improving interpretability methods in machine learning.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed my MS in Computer Science (Big Data Systems) at Arizona State University. I defended my thesis on [Yuksel Splines for Probabilistic Sequence Prediction](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=2oIjABsAAAAJ&citation_for_view=2oIjABsAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC). Before that, I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering at NSIT (now NSUT), University of Delhi.

My research interests include:

* Interpretability and Explainability in Machine Learning
* Algorithmic Fairness and Bias Mitigation
* Computer Vision
